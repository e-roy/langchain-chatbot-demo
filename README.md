# Langchain Chatbot Demo

This is a simple demo using Langchain, OpenAI and Chroma.

To run this demo, you need to have:

1. A Chroma client using Docker - [docs.trychroma.com](https://docs.trychroma.com/).
2. An OpenAI account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for free at [openai.com](https://www.openai.com).

## What it does

A simple chatbot to interact with any website that you enter in the top input field. In local development only.

After you enter a URL to crawl:

- if `website-collection` exists, is deleted. This is so you are only having a conversation with info from one site.
- url entered and urls found in crawl will be broken up into chunks and embeddeding to store in Chroma vector db as `website-collection`
- chat is now ready to ask questions about the site.
